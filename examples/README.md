# Examples
This folder should contain many examples to teach cloth simulation and facilitate development. 
List of current examples:
* `visualize_mesh`: visualizes an .obj mesh along with additional data computed on the mesh.

Future examples:
* Visualization of the forces exerted in simple deformation scenarios
* Collision visualizations


## Usage
```bash
cd silk/build
./visualize_mesh ../meshes/shirt_smooth.obj
```
